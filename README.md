# Testing Enumerable Methods Using RSpec
Add specs for all Enumerables methods you previously created.
> The aim of this project is to write specs for each enumerable method we created in the last project (Where we added new methods into the existing Enumerable module)

## Project specifications
1. Add specs for all Enumerables methods you previously created..
2. Wrap specs for each method in describe block
3. Instead of using before_each to define a variable for the test cases, use let.
4. Use one it block for each expected behaviour. Do not test multiple aspects in one it block.
5. Use your common sense: test positive and negative scenarios.
